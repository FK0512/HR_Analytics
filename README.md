## 🧩 Problem Statement

Every year, companies invest significantly in hiring and training new employees. However, retaining these employees is a constant challenge. This project aims to understand employee attrition using **HR Analytics**. The goal is to analyze patterns and factors that influence attrition, helping organizations improve retention strategies and minimize resource loss.

## 💼 What is HR Analytics?

**HR Analytics**, also known as People Analytics, involves using data and analytical processes to understand, improve, and optimize human resource functions. It is not just about measuring employee efficiency, but also about:

- Analyzing employee behavior and engagement
- Improving hiring decisions
- Enhancing performance management
- Designing effective compensation programs

---

## 🔄 Attrition in HR

Attrition refers to the gradual reduction of the workforce due to resignations, retirements, or other causes. High attrition impacts companies by:

- Increasing hiring and training costs
- Disrupting workflow and team dynamics
- Decreasing customer satisfaction
- Reducing accumulated knowledge base and internal expertise

---

## ❓ Why This Project Matters

Understanding **why employees leave** is crucial for building effective retention policies. With HR Analytics, we can:

- Identify key factors influencing attrition
- Predict which employees are at risk of leaving
- Suggest actionable strategies to improve employee satisfaction

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` – Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` – Numerical operations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Data visualization
- `sklearn` – Machine learning models and evaluation
- `scipy`, `statsmodels` – Statistical analysis (if applicable)

---

## 🧠 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Wrangling**
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert categorical variables
   - Check for outliers and duplicates

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize attrition trends by age, department, job role, etc.
   - Understand correlation between features and target (Attrition)

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Derive new features for better model performance
   - Normalize/standardize variables as needed

4. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree / Random Forest
   - SVM / KNN / XGBoost

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Curve

---

## 📊 Sample Insights

- Employees with lower job satisfaction and work-life balance are more likely to leave
- Attrition is higher among younger employees with fewer years at the company
- Monthly income and overtime strongly correlate with attrition

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Build a predictive dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Power BI**
- Add time-based attrition analysis (monthly/quarterly trends)
- Include sentiment analysis from employee feedback (if available)
